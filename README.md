# Student Record Management System in C

This is a console-based Student Record Management System written in C. It allows users to manage student records through a menu-driven interface and uses file handling for persistent data storage.

## 📌 Features

- ➕ Add new student records
- 📄 View all student records
- 🔍 Search for a student by roll number
- ❌ Delete a student record
- 🛠️ Modify existing student records


## 🗃️ Data Storage
All student records are stored in a file named record.txt.
The file uses binary format, so do not edit it manually.
The program automatically creates this file if it doesn’t exist.

## 🔒 Dependencies
Standard C Libraries
Uses windows.h and conio.h, so Windows-only compatibility (or needs adaptation for Unix)

## 📌 Notes
Make sure record.txt is in the same directory as main.c while running.
system("cls") is used to clear the screen, which is specific to Windows.

## 📜 License
